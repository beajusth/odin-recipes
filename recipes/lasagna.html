  <h4>Classic lasagna</h4>
  <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch. If that's the case for you, try out our best homemade spaghetti sauce—simple in ingredients and rich in flavor, it'll never let you down. </p>
  <p>Regardless of the route you choose to go down, make sure to follow these tips—We've reworked this recipe based on user comments to make it even better with more meat, more sauce, and more cheese!</p>
